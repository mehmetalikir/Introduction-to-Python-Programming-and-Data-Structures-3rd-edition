'''(Nested bubble sort) Write a program which reads test results from a text file and
sorts them by teh person who took the test then the test results themselves.
The sorting should be implemented as a bubble sort.
    The text file contains records in the following format(the name followed by
four test scores):

    Markus, 45, 47, 65, 77
    Ariana, 99, 53, 87, 43
    Eric, 19, 91, 65, 67
    Irena, 95, 91, 87, 67

    Load the results into a multidimensional list, such as:
    [['Markus', ['45', '47', '65', '77']]

After performing the sorts, the results should be printed.'''
