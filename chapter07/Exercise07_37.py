'''(Algebra: perfect square) Write a program that prompts the user to enter and integer
m ad find the smallest integer n such that m * n is a perfect square. (Hint:
Store all smallest factors of m into a list. n is the product of the factors that appear
an odd number of times in the list. For example, consider m = 90, store the
factors 2, 3, 3, 5 in a lsit. 2 and 5 appear an odd number of times in the vector.
So, n is 10)'''
