'''(Game: bean machine) The bean machine, also known as a quincunx or the Galton
box, is a device for statistics experiments named after English scientist Sir
Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs)
in a triangular pattern, as shown in Figure 7.9.

Balls are dropped from the opening of the board. Every time a ball hits a nail, it
has a 50% chance of falling to the left or to the right. The piles of balls are accumulated
in the slots at the bottom of the board.
Write a program that simulates the bean machine. Your program should prompt
the user to enter the number of the balls and the number of the slots in the machine.
Simulate the falling of each ball by printing its path. For example, the path for
the ball in Figure 7.9b is LLRRLLR and the path for the ball in Figure 7.9c is
RLRRLRR. Display the final buildup of the balls in the slots in a histogram.

(Hint: Create a list named slots. Each element in slots stores the number
of balls in a slot. Each ball falls into a slot via a path. The number of Rs in
a path is the position of the slot where the ball falls. For example, for the path
LRLRLRR, the ball falls into slots[4], and for the path is RRLLLLL, the ball
falls into slots[2].)'''
