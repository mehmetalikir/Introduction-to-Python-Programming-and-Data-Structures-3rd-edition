'''(Revise Listing 5.14, PrimeNumber.py) Listing 5.14 determines whether a number
n is prime by checking whether 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n/2 is a divisor. If a divisor
is found, n is not prime. A more efficient approach is to check whether any of the
prime numbers less than or equal to 2n can divide n evenly. If not, n is prime.
Rewrite Listing 5.14 to display the first 50 prime numbers using this approach.
You need to use a list to store the prime numbers and later use them to check
whether they are possible divisors for n.'''
