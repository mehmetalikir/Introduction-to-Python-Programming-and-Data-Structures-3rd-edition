'''(Tkinter: Display an n-sided regular polygon) Define a subclass of Canvas,
named RegularPolygonCanvas, to paint an n-sided regular polygon. The class
contains a property named numberOfSides, which specifies the number of sides
in the polygon. The polygon is centered in the canvas, and the polygonâ€™s size is
proportional to the size of the canvas. Create a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon,
heptagon, and octagon from RegularPolygonPanel and display them, as
shown in Figure 12.30.'''
