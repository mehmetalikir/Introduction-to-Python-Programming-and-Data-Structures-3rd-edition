'''(Game: ATM) Use the Account class created in Exercise 7.3 to simulate
an ATM. Create ten accounts in a list with the ids 0, 1, ..., 9, and an initial
balance of $100. The system prompts the user to enter an id. If the id is entered
incorrectly, ask the user to enter a correct id. Once an id is accepted, the main
menu is displayed as shown in the sample run. You can enter a choice of 1 for
viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for depositing money,
and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once you exit, the system will prompt for an id
again. So, once the system starts, it wonâ€™t stop.'''
