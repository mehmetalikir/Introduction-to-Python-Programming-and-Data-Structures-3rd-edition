'''(Tkinter: Mandelbrot fractal) The Mandelbrot fractal is a well-known image
created from a Mandelbrot set (see Figure 12.26a). A Mandelbrot set is defined
using the following iteration:
c is a complex number, and the starting point of the iteration is (For
information on complex numbers, see Exercise 9.15.) For a given c, the iteration
will produce a sequence of complex numbers: It can be
shown that the sequence either tends to infinity or stays bounded, depending on
the value of c. For example, if c is 0, the sequence is which is
bounded. If c is i, the sequence is which
is bounded. If c is the sequence is which is
unbounded. It is known that if the absolute value of a complex value in the
sequence is greater than 2, then the sequence is unbounded. The Mandelbrot set
consists of the c value such that the sequence is bounded. For example, 0 and i
are in the Mandelbrot set. A Mandelbrot image can be created using the following
code:

COUNT_LIMIT = 60

# Paint a Mandelbrot image in the canvas
def paint():
    x = -2.0
    while x < 2.0:
        y = -2.0
        while y < 2.0:
            c = count(complex(x, y))
            if c == COUNT_LIMIT:
                color = "red" # c is in a Mandelbrot set
            else:
                color = "#" + toHex(c * 37 % 256) + toHex(
                   c * 58 % 256) + toHex(c * 159 % 256)

            #print(color)
            # Fill a tiny rectangle with the specified color
            canvas.create_rectangle(x * 100 + 200, y * 100 + 200,
                x * 100 + 200 + 5, y * 100 + 200 + 5, fill = color)
            y += 0.05
        x += 0.05

# Returns the iteration count
def count(c):
    z = complex(0, 0) # z0

    for i in range(COUNT_LIMIT):
        z = z * z + c # Get z1, z2, ...
        if abs(z) > 2: return i # The sequence is unbounded

    return COUNT_LIMIT # Indicate a bounded sequence

The count(c) function (lines 23–28) computes If none of their
absolute values exceeds 2, we assume c is in the Mandelbrot set. Of course,
there could always be an error, but 60 (COUNT_LIMIT) iterations usually are
enough. Once we find that the sequence is unbounded, the method returns the
iteration count (line 28). The method returns COUNT_LIMIT if the sequence is
bounded (line 30).
The loop in lines 6–20 examines each point (x, y) for and
with interval 0.01 to see if its corresponding complex number
is in the Mandelbrot set (line 9). If so, paint the point red (line 11).
If not, set a color that is dependent on its iteration count (line 14). Note that the
point is painted in a square with width 5 and height 5. All the points are scaled
and mapped to a grid of pixels (lines 17–18).
