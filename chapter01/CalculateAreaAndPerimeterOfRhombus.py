#(Area and perimeter of a rhombus) Write a program that displays the area and
# perimeter of a rhombus with the length of a side of 7.3 and height of 4.2 using
# the following formula:
#                       area = length of a side x height
#                       perimeter = 4 x length of a side x height -> This formula is wrong



#Display the area of rhombus
a = 7.3
b = 4.2
area = a * b
print("area:", area, "'cm^2")

#Calculate the perimeter of an incorrectly formulated rhombus
#perimeter = 4 * a * b
#print("perimeter:", perimeter, "'cm")

#Calculate the perimeter of an correctly formulated rhombus
perimeter = 4 * a
print("perimeter:", perimeter, "'cm")
