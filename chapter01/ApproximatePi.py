#(Approximate π) π can be copmputed using the following formula :
# π = 4  x (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11))
# Write a program that displays the result of 4  x (1 - (1/3) + (1/5 - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11)) and
# 4  x (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11) + (1/13) - (1/15)



pi0 = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11))
pi1 = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11) + (1/13) - (1/15))

#Compute π with different values
print(pi0)
print(pi1)
