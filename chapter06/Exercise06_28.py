'''(Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program
to play a variation of the game, as follows:
Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, â€¦, and 6, respectively.
Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you
lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value
(i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. Continue to roll the dice until either
a 7 or the same point value is rolled. If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
Your program acts as a single player.'''
