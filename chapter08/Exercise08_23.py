'''(Game: find the flipped cell) Suppose you are given a 6 x 6 matrix filled
with 0s and 1s. All rows and all columns have the even number of 1s. Let the
user flip one cell (i.e., flip from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1) and write a program to
find which cell was flipped. Your program should prompt the user to enter a
6 x 6 two-dimensional list with 0s and 1s and find the first row r and first
column c where the even number of 1s property is violated. The flipped cell
is at (r, c).'''
