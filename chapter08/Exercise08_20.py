'''(Game: Connect Four) Connect Four is a two-player board game in which the
players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically
suspended grid, as shown below:

The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, column,
or diagonal before your opponent does. The program prompts two players
to drop a red or yellow disk alternately. Whenever a disk is dropped, the program
redisplays the board on the console and determines the status of the game
(win, draw, or continue).'''
