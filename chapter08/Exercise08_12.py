'''(Financial application: compute tax) Rewrite Listing 4.7, ComputeTax.py, using
lists. For each filing status, there are six tax rates. Each rate is applied to a certain
amount of taxable income. For example, from the taxable income of $400,000 for
a single filer, $8,350 is taxed at 10%, (33,950 – 8,350) at 15%, (82,250 – 33,950)
at 25%, (171,550 – 82,250) at 28%, (372,950 – 171,550) at 33%, and (400,000 –
372,950) at 35%. The six rates are the same for all filing statuses, which can be
represented in the following list:

    rates = [0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.28, 0.33, 0.35]

The brackets for each rate for all the filing statuses can be represented in a two dimensional
list as follows:

brackets = [
    [8350, 33950, 82250, 171550, 372950], # Single filer
    [16700, 67900, 137050, 208850, 372950], # Married jointly
    [8350, 33950, 68525, 104425, 186475], # Married separately
    [11950, 45500, 117450, 190200, 372950] # Head of household
]

Suppose the taxable income is $400,000 for single filers. The tax can be computed
as follows:
    tax = brackets[0][0] * rates[0] +
        (brackets[0][1] – brackets[0][0]) * rates[1] +
        (brackets[0][2] – brackets[0][1]) * rates[2] +
        (brackets[0][3] – brackets[0][2]) * rates[3] +
        (brackets[0][4] – brackets[0][3]) * rates[4] +
        (400000 – brackets[0][4]) * rates[5]'''


def main():
    status = int(input("(0-single filer, 1-married jointly,\n" +
                       "2-married separately, 3-head of household)\n" +
                       "Enter the filing status: "))

    if status > 3 or status < 0:
        print("Error: Wrong status")
    else:
        # Prompt the user to enter taxable income
        income = float(input("Enter the taxable income: "))

        # Compute and display the result
        print("Tax is", format(computeTax(status, income), "7.2f"))
