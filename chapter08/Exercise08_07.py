'''(Points nearest to each other) The program in Listing 8.3 finds the two points in a
two-dimensional space nearest to each other. Revise the program so that it finds the
two points in a three-dimensional space nearest to each other. Use a two-dimensional
list to represent the points. Test the program using the following points:
points = [[-1, 0, 3], [-1, -1, -1], [4, 1, 1],
[2, 0.5, 9], [3.5, 2, -1], [3, 1.5, 3], [-1.5, 4, 2],
[5.5, 4, -0.5]]

The formula for computing the distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and
(x2, y2, z2) in a three-dimensional space is âˆš(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2.'''
