'''(Pattern recognition: four consecutive equal numbers) Write the following
function that tests whether a two-dimensional list has four consecutive numbers
of the same value, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally:

    def isConsecutiveFour(values):

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the number of rows and
columns of a two-dimensional list and then the values in the list. The program
displays True if the list contains four consecutive numbers with the
same value; otherwise, it displays False. Here are some examples of the
True cases:'''


def main():
    pass


def getIt():
    pass


main()  # Invoke main function
